This directory contains a dmraid library format handler template.

See template.h for a basic header defining the ondisk metadata structures
and template.c showing the basic code structure of a format handler.
Watch the CODEME remarks for coding areas to cover.
You probably want to look at lib/format/ataraid/*.[ch] as well ;)

Put your format handler .h and .c files into an appropriate (new)
subdirectory (eg, another ATARAID format handler goes into lib/format/ataraid),
add your register function to lib/format/register.h, add your header file
to lib/format/ondisk.h and add the .c file to SOURCES in lib/Makefile.in
(don't forget to run configure before make).
